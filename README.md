# CS370

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The purpose of this project involves training an AI agent to navigate a maze using reinforcement learning. We were given predefined classes which contained logic for the environment. The code I created was to apply a deep Q-learning algorithm to solve the pathfinding problem for the intelligent agent.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve complex problems using algorithms, data structures, and computational models. They design software, develop AI models, optimize systems, and create innovative solutions that impact industries like healthcare, finance, and entertainment.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
The approach can be broken down into steps:
1. Understand the Problem: Break it down into components.
2. Plan a Solution: Identify algorithms that can be applied.
3. Implement and Test: Code the solution, run simulations, and tweak parameters.
4. Evaluate and Optimize: Measure performance, debug issues, and refine the algorithm.
   
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities:
1. Transparency: Ensure the AI behavior is explainable and predictable.
2. Fairness: Avoid biases in AI training.
3. Privacy and Security: Protect data used in AI models.
4. Reliability: Ensure the system performs as expected without unintended consequences.
